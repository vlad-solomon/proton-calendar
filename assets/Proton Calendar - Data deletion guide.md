# Proton Calendar - Data deletion guide

### Using the app to delete data
These are the instructions to request deletion of data, including all personal information stored by the app and all the information the user has created and manipulated by using it.

1. Log into your account at [Proton Calendar](https://vlad-solomon.github.io/proton-calendar/) by using either the Google Provider or the Facebook Provider
2. Navigate to the settings panel (upper right corner, marked by a gear icon)
3. Navigate to the account section of the setting panel
4. Click on the "Disable account" button

All personal information in the database will be deleted and all the data the user has generated will be marked for deletion. This process can take up to 30 days to fulfil, but the user is free to create another account with the same credentials as before and generate new and separate data from the old account, in the meantime.

###### Note: Deletion of data is permanent and cannot be undone.

### Requesting data deletion directly

Anyone can request a data deletion directly by sending an email to vladsolomon720@gmail.com with the subject of "Proton Calendar - Data Deletion Request." After a confirmation, all user data stored by the app will be promptly deleted.
